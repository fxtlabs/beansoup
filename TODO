* Write a plugin to move document directive up one day so they appear after
  their transactions.
  Perhaps limit it to a set of given accounts

* Write OFX importer (banking only?) that can name files according to the
  billing period

* Write import filter to help balance clearing accounts

* Add plugin like pending_plugin, but restricted to common accounts with
  Clearing component

* TD importers should be able to generate tags for transactions involving a
  clearing account (I can now use an import filter for that)
