* Maybe ignored_tag of clear_transactions plugin should be a regexp

* Finish clear_transactions plugin; add documentation and example

* Should clear_transactions plugin be able to print out pending transactions?

* Should I turn sort_docs plugin into a general sort_order plugin?
  Martin would not like that

* Mark beansoup.plugins.sort_docs as deprecated or remove it altogether

* Write OFX importer (banking only?) that can name files according to the
  billing period

* Write tests for everything

* Consider adding examples
